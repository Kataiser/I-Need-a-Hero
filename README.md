# I-Need-a-Hero
Automatic hero suggester for Overwatch

v0.1 download: https://github.com/Kataiser/I-Need-a-Hero/releases

Uses image recognition, based on an automatically loaded screenshot, to suggest the best (and worst) heroes for you and your team to play.

Installation and running instructions:
Unzip to \Documents\Overwatch\ScreenShots (but not to Documents\Overwatch\ScreenShots\Overwatch) and launch setup.bat (double click). To run, launch run.bat, hold tab and press the "print screen" button.

Requirements: Python 3.6 (https://www.python.org/downloads). Libraries are downloaded by setup.bat.

NOTE: it auto deletes screenshots it deems to be of the tab menu, so keep that in mind.

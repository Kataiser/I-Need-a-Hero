Some of these aren't very good. If you want to help improve them (requires computer literacy):

1. Download the "source" code from https://github.com/Kataiser/I-Need-a-Hero
2. Download the "learning" folder from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_BfBIVUNMqmV3JabnJydTRpSW8?usp=sharing
3. Take a bunch of screenshots of the tab menu (the more the better)
4. Run them through the extractor (or the bulk one)
5. Add the portraits to the learning folder with proper and unique names
6. Run learning2learned.py
7. Submit a pull request with the updated learned folder

If something goes wrong, contact me.
